## Example Summary

I2C Controller writes and reads multiple bytes to/from a target device.
The example uses FIFO and polling.
The Target device must be enabled and active before running this example. The target device should run i2c_target_rw_multibyte_fifo_poll example.

This example can be used to validate I2C communication, as a starting point to
control any I2C target, or to create custom drivers.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM33C321A LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/mspm33/esd/MSPM33-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM33 devices.
### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM33 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM33C321A User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slau962).

> **Note:** I2C requires pull-up resistors on SDA and SCL lines. If pull-up resistors are not present on the board, connect external pull-up resistors (typically 4.7kΩ to 3.3V) on the SDA and SCL pins before running this example.

## Example Usage

Connect SDA and SCL between I2C Controller and Target.
Compile, load and run the example.
The controller sends some data to the target and expects to receive some data from the target. If it receives the data, it will match with the expected data and if they match, the PASS_LED will be set or else, the FAIL_LED will be set.
