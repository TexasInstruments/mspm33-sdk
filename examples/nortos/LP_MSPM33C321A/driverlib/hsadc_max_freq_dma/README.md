## Example Summary
This example demonstrates how to run the ADC at it's maximum sampling rate. One ADC Sequencer configured with one SOC to receive trigger from TIMA0 and the results are transferred via DMA to the result variable.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for the MSPM33C321A device included in the LP_MSPM33C321A LaunchPad.

MSPM33 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM33C321A User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slau962).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Once the DMA done signal is generated, the adcResult array can be inspected. Since the sampling rate is at 9.375 MHz, signals with frequency upto 4.6875 MHz can be detected and the same can be verified using the abovementioned result array.

On powerup, the ADC pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
