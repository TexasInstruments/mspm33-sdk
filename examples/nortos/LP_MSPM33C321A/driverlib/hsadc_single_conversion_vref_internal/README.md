## Example Summary

The following example configures HSADC0 to trigger single conversion by software
using an internal VREF of 1.4V.
An LED turns on if the ADC input > 0.5*VREF, otherwise it turns off. The HSADC_MONITOR_VALUE macro is used to represent this monitoring voltage.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for the MSPM33C321A device included in the LP_MSPM33C321A LaunchPad.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM33 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM33C321A User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slau962).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Provide a valid voltage to A0 between 0 - 1.4V.
Monitor LED1 while input voltage changes.

On powerup, the ADC and VREF pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
