## Example Summary

The following example processes data using ppb in adc. The example demonstrates the use of right shift arithmetic. Two sequencers are used in this example, the first sequencer right shifts the result of the adc conversion by 1 bits and the second sequencer right shifts the result of the adc conversion by 2 bits.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM33C321A LaunchPad.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM33 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM33C321A User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slau962).

## Example Usage
VREF is configured in external mode by default. Connect a stable external voltage reference (default 2V) to PA23 (VREF+) before running the example.
Compile, load and run the example. The debugger will stop at a SW breakpoint, and the user can verify whether the results has been right shifted accordingly.

On powerup, the ADC pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
