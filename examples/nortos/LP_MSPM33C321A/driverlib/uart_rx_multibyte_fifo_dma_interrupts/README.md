## Example Summary

This example sets up the UART to both transmit to and wait to receive data from another UART device using DMA.
The example can be used with the uart_tx_multibyte_fifo_dma_interrupts example running on another device.
The DMA in configured in single transfer mode, using the static UART RX DMA event as the DMA trigger.
When data is received in the UART RXFIFO, this triggers the DMA to transfer the data from the UART RXFIFO to a buffer.
UART EOT_DONE and DMA_DONE_TX is used to transmit the data.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM33C321A LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/mspm33/esd/MSPM33-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM33 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM33 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM33C321A User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slau962).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Connect the RX and TX between two MSPM33 devices.
The example will wait to receive 64 bytes of data from the transmitting device. It will also send 64 bytes to the other device.
The PASS_LED will turn ON to indicate that the example has completed without errors, else, FAIL_LED will turn on.
The received data can be verified in the rrxdata.
