## Example Summary

Empty project using DriverLib.
This example demonstrates a basic empty project using DriverLib with just a main file
and SysConfig initialization. 

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

| Peripheral | Pin | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SYSCTL |  |  |
| DEBUGSS | PA20 | Debug Clock (SWCLK) |
| DEBUGSS | PA19 | Debug Data In/Out (SWDIO) |

| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | N/A | <ul><li>PA20 is used by SWD during debugging</ul> |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | N/A | <ul><li>PA19 is used by SWD during debugging</ul> |

### Device Migration Recommendations

This project was developed for the MSPM33C321A device included in the LP_MSPM33C321A LaunchPad.

### Low-Power Recommendations

TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM33 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM33C321A User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slau962).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
The example initializes the system with default clock settings (32 MHz CPU clock) and enters an infinite loop. This provides a clean starting point for developing your own applications.
