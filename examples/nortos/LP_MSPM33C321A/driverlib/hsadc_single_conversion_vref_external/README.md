## Example Summary

The following example configures HSADC0 to trigger conversion by software continuously
and turn on LED1 if ADC > 0.5*(external vref). Otherwise, LED1 remains off.

This example configures the VREF instance which the HSADC uses as external voltage reference.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for the MSPM33C321A device included in the LP_MSPM33C321A LaunchPad.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM33 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM33C321A User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slau962).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Provide a valid voltage to HSADC0_0 (Voltage
source for ADC is expected to be between 0 - External Vref (external reference
shouldn't exceed VDD) and monitor LED1. LED1 will be turned on when ADC
conversion greater than (External Vref / 2).

On powerup, the ADC and VREF pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
