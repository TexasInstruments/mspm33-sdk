## Example Summary

This code example demonstrates how to use the ML-DSA-87 key generation 
function to generate new ML-DSA-87 secret and public keys from a seed.

The NIST CAVP FIPS 204 ML-DSA key generation test case ID #51 is used here
to demonstate the key generation computation.  The routine is expected
to return a success status and the actual (computed) sk/pk keys are 
expected to match the expected (stored) key values.
